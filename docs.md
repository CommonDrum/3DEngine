## Linux

    For linux you can use the run.sh script to build and compile the code.
    Remember to have all of the dependecies installed but cmake should

        ```./run.sh cmake``` Generate the build files. Then build, compile and run the program.
        ```./run.sh```  Uses the files from "build" directory to build, compile and run.
